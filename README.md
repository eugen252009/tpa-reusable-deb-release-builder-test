# TPA — Tool for Package Automation

TPA creates Debian package directory trees, builds and inspects `.deb` files,
and derives small APT repositories from package artifacts.

```text
filesystem input → TPA → filesystem output
```

The `.deb` artifacts are authoritative package state. `Packages`, `Release`,
and `InRelease` are derived repository state; TPA does not require a persistent
package database or metadata cache.

## Requirements

- `dpkg-deb` for package building and fallback inspection of unsupported `.deb` formats
- `gzip` for compressed package indexes
- `gpg` when signing repositories or verifying `InRelease` signatures
- `ssh` for read-only SSH inspection; `sftp` for SSH output
- Linux and a filesystem supporting `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)` for replacing
  an existing local repository atomically

Build a development binary with:

```sh
go build -o tpa .
./tpa version  # dev
```

The authoritative runtime version defaults to `dev`. `build.sh` injects the
single `TPA_VERSION` value into the host and packaged binaries and uses that
same value for Debian `Version`; automatic `TPA-Version` provenance and help
output read the injected runtime value. Set `TPA_VERSION` for release builds.

`tpa --help` and `tpa -h` show the command list and project/support identity;
`tpa --version` prints `tpa <version>`. Running `tpa` without a command prints
the same help and returns status 2.

## CLI contract

| Command | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | Package metadata flags | Package root at `-out`, including `DEBIAN/control`, maintainer scripts, and `usr/local/bin` |
| `build` | Package root at `-in` | `.deb` archive or destination directory at `-out`, using `dpkg-deb --root-owner-group --build` |
| `parse` | `.deb` archive at `-in` | Human-readable parsed control summary on standard output |
| `pack` | Top-level `.deb` files in `-in`, an optional JSON config path, or `--empty` | Verified APT repository at local or SSH/SFTP `--output`, or local `--atomic-publish`; optionally a generation inventory |
| `inspect` | Local repository path or read-only HTTP(S)/SSH locator | Release metadata and rich package-index entries; optionally exact `-package`, `-ver`, `-arch` lookup |
| `verify` | Local repository path or read-only HTTP(S)/SSH locator | Verifies Release/index integrity, signatures when present, and every indexed `.deb` artifact |
| `unlist` | Repository at `-in` and exact `-package`, `-ver`, `-arch` identity | Atomically removes that identity from APT metadata and retains its `.deb` |
| `delete` | Repository at `-in` and exact `-package`, `-ver`, `-arch` identity | Confirms, unlists if needed, verifies and publishes metadata, then removes the `.deb` |
| `json` | Configuration JSON on standard input | Initialized package root at JSON `outdir` |
| `schema` | None | TypeScript-style configuration interface on standard output |
| `version` | None | TPA program version on standard output |
| `capabilities` | None | Versioned machine-readable capability and repository-format contract |

`tpa version` prints only the version for scripts. `tpa --version` (also
`tpa -version`) prints `tpa <version>`. Help identifies the project as
https://github.com/eugen252009/tpa and lists support / bug reports at
`tpa@lupricht.net`.

`parse` and repository generation normally read control metadata in process for
plain, gzip-compressed, and xz-compressed control archives. Unsupported archive
formats use a bounded `dpkg-deb -f` fallback; malformed supported archives fail
directly rather than being hidden by fallback.

Exit status is part of the process contract:

```text
0        command completed successfully, or delete was cancelled without changes
non-zero command failed or its invocation was invalid
```

Diagnostics are written to standard error. Callers should use the exit status,
not match diagnostic text.

### Important flags

Package flags include `-name`, `-ver`, `-arch`, `-maintainer`, `-desc`,
`-depends`, `-pre-depends`, `-recommends`, `-suggests`, `-provides`,
`-conflicts`, `-breaks`, `-replaces`, `-homepage`, `-section`, `-priority`,
`-built-using`, `-essential`, `-multi-arch`, `-preinst`, `-postinst`, `-prerm`,
and `-postrm`.

Repository flags include `-origin`, `-label`, `-suite`, `-codename`,
`-components`, and `-repo-description`. Canonical empty initialization is
`tpa pack --empty`; `-architectures` defaults to `all` there and accepts a
comma-separated override. `pack --empty` defaults to suite/codename `stable`
and component `main`; these Release fields can be overridden. It refuses existing
output destinations. Safe local initialization is supported on Linux, Darwin,
and Windows; `tpa capabilities` reports platform support. Lifecycle commands use
`-package`, `-ver`, and `-arch` for the canonical package identity and `-in`
for the existing repository tree. For
a non-default distribution or component, set `-codename` and `-components` to
match that tree. Read-only `inspect` and `verify` take one repository locator
positionally and use `-codename` (default `stable`) to select the distribution.
`delete` accepts `--yes` for explicit non-interactive approval;
without it, deletion requires a terminal and accepts only `y` or `yes` (case
insensitive). `-gpg` is required for a signed repository and must select its
signer. The `pack` command's `-workers` option bounds package inspection,
source hashing during pool copy, and published-artifact verification; zero (the
default) derives the worker count from `GOMAXPROCS`, capped at 32. Normal `pack`
infers repository architectures from actual `.deb` artifacts; `pack --empty`
uses `all` by default or accepts an explicit architecture list. `-gpg` selects a signing key.
The general path flags are `-in` and `-out`. For `pack`, `--output` accepts a
local path or SSH destination; `--atomic-publish` is local-only and selects
atomic replacement. SSH destinations use either `ssh://[user@]host[:port]/path`
or SCP-style `host:path` syntax. `--ssh-config` selects an OpenSSH client config
when needed; otherwise the OpenSSH client's normal config and identities are
used. Unknown or changed host keys are rejected. SSH output publishes only to a
new path; it never replaces an existing remote repository. Remote activation
uses same-parent SFTP directory rename and requires the remote parent to exclude
out-of-band writers. See [SSH output](docs/ssh-output.md) for guarantees and
failure recovery. For external candidate transport, `-generation-manifest`,
`-repository-id`, and `-generation-id` write a versioned inventory after
repository verification; `-parent-generation` records the expected parent. The
inventory is not authorization or publication by itself.

### Read-only repository inspection and verification

`inspect` and `verify` operate on an existing APT tree without modifying it.
Locators may be a local directory, `http://` or `https://` URL, or an absolute
`ssh://[user@]host[:port]/path` URL. A no-scheme host-like locator defaults to
HTTPS (`example.invalid/apt`). Absolute paths and explicit `./` or `../` paths
are local. An existing relative directory is also treated as local. HTTP(S)
redirects are bounded and HTTPS redirects may not downgrade to HTTP. SSH reads
use the system `ssh` client in batch mode and require a trusted host key; no
remote command other than reading the requested file is run.

`inspect` reads `Release`/`InRelease` and the plain, gzip, or xz `Packages`
indexes advertised by Release, checks each index's Release SHA256/size, and returns all Debian control
fields. It does not download `.deb` files. If `InRelease` exists but no public
keyring is provided, output explicitly marks its signature as present but
unverified; a standalone `InRelease` without a corresponding `Release` needs a
keyring so its payload can be verified and read. Exact lookup requires the
complete canonical identity:

```sh
tpa inspect --json -codename=bookworm \\
  -package=example -ver=1.2.3 -arch=amd64 https://apt.example.invalid
```

`verify` checks all listed packages, including artifact size, SHA256, and the
identity inside each `.deb`. An `InRelease` signature is always verified when
present; `-require-signed` also rejects unsigned repositories. Supply an
exported **public** OpenPGP keyring with `-keyring`; TPA rejects secret-key
material. `-fingerprint` optionally pins the full expected signer fingerprint.
For example:

```sh
gpg --batch --armor --export "$APT_FINGERPRINT" > apt-public-keys.asc
tpa verify --json -keyring=apt-public-keys.asc \\
  -fingerprint="$APT_FINGERPRINT" https://apt.example.invalid
```

A valid `InRelease` can be verified without trusting the user's ambient GPG
keyring; only the supplied public key material is imported in an isolated
temporary keyring. Detached `Release.gpg` signatures are not currently
supported. `--json` emits one JSON document to standard output; verification
failures are included in the JSON response and return non-zero. Human output is
default. Release metadata is bounded to 32 MiB, package indexes to 256 MiB, the
public key input to 1 MiB, and the report to 100,000 package identities. Each
verified archive is limited to 16 GiB; concurrent temporary archive storage is
budgeted to 2 GiB (a larger single archive is processed exclusively). Temporary
files are removed when the command finishes.

## Package creation

Relationship flags include `-depends`, `-pre-depends`, `-recommends`,
`-suggests`, `-provides`, `-conflicts`, `-breaks`, and `-replaces`.
Maintainer scripts are separate from control metadata. CLI script flags are
`-preinst`, `-postinst`, `-prerm`, and `-postrm`; their values are script
bodies, not paths to script files.

```sh
tpa init \
  -name=hello-tpa -ver=1.0.0 -arch=all \
  -maintainer='Example <example@example.invalid>' \
  -desc='Example package' -depends='dependency-package' \
  -out=build/hello-tpa

tpa build -in=build/hello-tpa -out=dist/hello-tpa_1.0.0_all.deb
```

`tpa json` performs the same initialization from standard input. Omitted fields
retain the CLI defaults. The JSON uses the field names printed by `tpa schema`.
The `json` command initializes a package tree only; it does not build a `.deb`.

The preferred JSON structure separates control metadata from maintainer scripts:

```json
{
  "control": {
    "name": "example",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "architecture": "all",
    "maintainer": "Example",
    "description": "Example",
    "packageType": "backup",
    "memaService": "example",
    "memaSchema": 1
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinst": "echo installed"
  },
  "outdir": "build/example"
}
```

Known Debian fields remain typed. Additional scalar control fields are accepted
without a TPA code change and are converted generically: `packageType` becomes
`Package-Type`, `memaService` becomes `Mema-Service`, and `memaSchema` becomes
`Mema-Schema`. Strings, numbers, and booleans are supported; arrays, objects,
nulls, unsafe names, control characters, and field-name collisions are rejected.

TPA adds `TPA-Version: <version>` and a UTC RFC3339 `Created-At` field when
those fields are not supplied explicitly. Explicit equivalent metadata values
win and are emitted once. Use `tpa json --no-provenance` (or the equivalent
package-definition command) to disable only automatic generation; explicit
provenance-shaped metadata and all other custom fields are preserved. The
configuration property `provenance: false` provides the persistent equivalent.
TPA does not assign semantics to arbitrary custom fields; it transports them as
Debian control metadata.

For compatibility, legacy `preinstbody`, `postinstbody`, `prermbody`, and
`postrmbody` fields are accepted and normalized into `scripts`. They are never
emitted as control fields.

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{
  "control": {
    "name": "hello-tpa",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "architecture": "all",
    "maintainer": "Example <example@example.invalid>",
    "description": "Example package"
  },
  "outdir": "build/hello-tpa"
}' | tpa json
```

## Repository generation

TPA reads the actual control stanza from every input `.deb` and preserves its
Debian metadata in `Packages`. It removes any package-provided `Filename`,
`Size`, and `SHA256` fields and appends values derived from the actual published
artifact. Custom control fields therefore remain visible to APT consumers and
metadata inspectors.

```sh
tpa pack -in=dist -out=repo
```

Create an initially empty repository with the canonical `pack --empty`
workflow. It refuses any existing destination:

```sh
tpa pack --empty --output=repo \
  -suite=stable -codename=stable -components=main \
  -architectures=amd64,arm64
# Add the first package using the same repository settings.
tpa pack -in=dist --atomic-publish=repo \
  -suite=stable -codename=stable -components=main
```

`pack` without `--empty` still rejects an empty artifact directory. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` may be
set to a non-negative Unix timestamp to make `Release.Date` reproducible; the
default is the current UTC time, and OpenPGP signatures may still vary.

For the default codename and component, output has this form:

```text
repo/
├── index.html                             # generic browser for the repository
├── repository.json                        # machine-readable package metadata
├── dists/stable/Release
├── dists/stable/InRelease                 # only when signed
├── dists/stable/main/binary-<arch>/Packages
├── dists/stable/main/binary-<arch>/Packages.gz
└── pool/main/<initial>/<package>/<original-archive-name>.deb
```

Opening the repository root in a browser serves a static package listing.
The static page and JSON inventory use repository-relative package links.
`repository.json` has `format: "tpa-repository-index"`, `version: 1`, and a
`packages` array sorted lexically by Package, Version, Architecture, then
artifact Filename. Each entry has a `metadata` object preserving Debian control
fields (including unknown/custom fields) and an `artifact` object with
`filename`, numeric `size`, and `sha256`. Empty repositories use an empty
`packages` array. The browser renders all metadata without JavaScript.
Lifecycle `unlist` operations regenerate both views from the updated APT
indexes. These root-level files are an inseparable convenience pair, not APT
trust metadata: they are not covered by `Release` or `InRelease`. See
[`docs/repository-format-v1.md`](docs/repository-format-v1.md) for the strict
format and independent-consumer requirements.

Local `-out` and `--output` select direct, non-atomic output and require a new
or empty path. Use `--atomic-publish` to replace a live local repository. Empty
repository initialization is `tpa pack --empty`. For remote SSH/SFTP output,
TPA builds and verifies a local
candidate, uploads and reads it back, then activates only a new destination.
Existing remote destinations are deliberately unsupported because generic SFTP
cannot safely replace a populated repository. Normal `pack` still rejects
empty artifact input.

For a completed repository, `-generation-manifest=<path>` writes a deterministic
versioned file inventory outside the repository tree. It requires
`-repository-id` and `-generation-id`; `-parent-generation` is optional. TPA
hashes every regular file after repository generation and verifies the inventory
against the final tree. The v1 contract bounds manifests to 16 MiB, 65,536 files,
4,096-byte/64-component paths, and 65,536 directories. The per-file inventory
and verification maps scale with file count but remain bounded by these fixed
limits. This inventory is transport metadata, not a replacement for APT's
signed Release metadata.

`pack` also accepts one positional JSON config file. `--output` and
`--atomic-publish` explicitly override the output path from that file. The
configuration file supplies the same package/repository fields as the CLI;
package artifacts are still read from the configured input directory.

## Repository semantics

The input artifact set defines the desired repository snapshot:

```text
artifact included in input → indexed in the generated repository
artifact omitted from input → absent from a fresh generated repository
```

TPA does not independently retain package history. To retain an older version,
keep its `.deb` in the desired input set.

Canonical package identity is:

```text
Package + Version + Architecture
```

- Same identity and byte-identical files are accepted idempotently and indexed
  once.
- Same identity and different bytes are rejected.

### Unlist and delete

`unlist` removes exactly one `Package + Version + Architecture` identity from
its architecture's `Packages` index, regenerates `Packages.gz` and `Release`,
re-signs `InRelease` when the repository is signed, verifies the complete
candidate, and atomically publishes it. The `.deb` remains in `pool` and may
still be directly downloaded by URL. Unlisting does not uninstall a package
from existing client systems; it only changes what fresh APT index updates
advertise. A later fresh `pack` from an artifact input that includes the `.deb`
will list it again.

`delete` is the confirmed destructive counterpart. It automatically performs
the same verified unlist transition when the exact identity is listed; when
already unlisted, it skips metadata mutation. Only after the new metadata tree
is verified and atomically active does TPA remove the artifact. The default
answer to the interactive prompt is no; only `y` or `yes` approves. Automation
must pass `--yes`. If metadata generation, signing, verification, or publication
fails, the artifact is retained and the active repository remains valid. If
artifact cleanup fails after unlisting, the command reports that safe partial
state: unlisted, artifact retained. TPA never deliberately leaves active
metadata referencing a missing artifact.

Lifecycle mutation uses a persistent hidden sibling lock file shared with
`pack --atomic-publish` and publishes a complete sibling candidate with the
existing Linux atomic directory exchange. Do not remove that lock file while
TPA writers may be active. TPA tracks no historical repository generations;
retention and rollback generations are owned by orchestration such as TPA.run.
`delete` only knows the repository tree path passed to it; an orchestrator must
ensure an artifact is not still needed by a separately retained generation.

```sh
tpa unlist -in=repo -package=foo -ver=1.2.3 -arch=amd64 \
  -gpg=FULL_SIGNING_FINGERPRINT

tpa delete -in=repo -package=foo -ver=1.2.3 -arch=amd64 \
  -gpg=FULL_SIGNING_FINGERPRINT --yes
```

Omit `-gpg` for an unsigned repository. `unlist` fails if that exact identity
is not listed. `delete` fails if its exact artifact cannot be found, and never
selects a package by filename alone.

## Verification

Before reporting repository-generation success, TPA verifies:

```text
.deb bytes
   │ Size + SHA256
   ▼
Packages
   │ index Size + SHA256
   ▼
Release
   │ signed payload
   ▼
InRelease
```

For every `Packages` entry, the referenced `Filename` must exist and its actual
size and SHA-256 must match. `Packages` and `Packages.gz` must match the size and
SHA-256 recorded in `Release`.

For signed repositories, the `InRelease` signature must be valid, its signer
must match the selected full fingerprint, and its signed payload must exactly
match `Release`.

## Signing

Use `-gpg` with a GPG selector; a full fingerprint is recommended:

```sh
tpa pack -in=dist -out=repo -gpg=FULL_SIGNING_FINGERPRINT
```

TPA invokes the installed `gpg` and uses the caller's GPG environment, including
`GNUPGHOME`. It selects one primary secret key, signs `Release`, and verifies the
result. It rejects expired, revoked, invalid, or ambiguous signature status and
requires the InRelease signature block to end the file. Key creation, storage,
expiration, and rotation remain GPG concerns.

## Reusable Debian release workflow

TPA also provides a tag-driven GitHub Actions workflow that uses TPA itself to
build project `.deb` files, verify package metadata and payloads, check
reproducibility, qualify configured architectures, and publish complete GitHub
Releases with checksums, source, manifests, provenance, and GitHub build
attestations. Project compilation and payload staging remain project-owned; the
workflow does not publish an APT repository. See
[`docs/reusable-deb-release.md`](docs/reusable-deb-release.md) for the
configuration contract, TPA dogfood setup, and TPA.run/MEMA adoption examples.

## Hosted integration boundary

`tpa capabilities` emits a versioned JSON contract
for automation, including the repository format, browser sidecars, supported
operations, readers, signing, and publication/transport boundaries. The
transport-independent candidate contract is documented in
[`docs/tparun-integration-contract.md`](docs/tparun-integration-contract.md).

Standalone TPA builds and verifies repository candidates and can publish one
outbound over SSH/SFTP to a new remote path. It does not implement hosted
authorization, quotas, managed key custody, or a hosted publication service. Any future hosted integration must submit candidates through TPA.run's
authorized `stage` / `status` / `publish` workflow after independent server-side
validation. It must never write directly to hosted live storage or pass a hosted
private signing key to the TPA build. Compatibility with a particular TPA.run
source/binary baseline is **NOT VERIFIED** by this standalone qualification.

## Atomic publication

Use `--atomic-publish` when replacing a repository that may be read
concurrently:

```sh
tpa pack -in=dist -atomic-publish=/srv/apt/example \
  -gpg=FULL_SIGNING_FINGERPRINT
```

When the destination exists, `AtomicPack` first verifies that it is a complete
TPA format-v1 repository (including sidecars and the current signature if
signed); for a signed destination, `-gpg` must verify its current signer. Key
rotation requires a separately verified migration. Arbitrary directories and
symlinks are never exchanged. On Linux, TPA then performs:

```text
fresh sibling staging tree
→ complete generation
→ repository verification, including paired sidecars
→ atomic rename exchange
→ replaced-tree cleanup
```

Failure before the exchange removes staging and leaves the previous repository
unchanged. A parent-directory sync failure after activation returns a typed
`AtomicPublishError` with `Published == true`: the new tree is active, but
durability of the activation rename is uncertain. Failure to remove the replaced tree is also reported
with `Published == true`; the old tree is retained at its staging path for
cleanup recovery. Do not blindly retry either case; inspect and verify the live
path first. Repository directories are published as `0755` and files as `0644`.
GPG key material is never copied into the repository tree.

## Qualification

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
./tests/qualification.sh
./tests/repository-contract-qualification.sh
./tests/ssh-output-qualification.sh
./tests/dependency-qualification.sh
./tests/version-qualification.sh
```

The signed qualification covers signature verification, APT install, upgrade,
and downgrade, plus signed unlist/delete against a live client that retains an
installed package. The repository-contract qualification covers empty signed
initialization, APT update, transition to the first package, browser sidecars,
and non-destructive refusal of existing paths. The SSH-output qualification
uses a disposable OpenSSH/SFTP server to check strict host-key behavior,
new-destination safety, interruption recovery, and APT install from a remote
repository tree. The dependency qualification proves that relationship
metadata survives repository generation and APT resolves both direct and
transitive dependencies automatically. The version qualification checks
package/runtime/provenance/help consistency.

## CI package qualification and production boundary

GitHub Actions in [`.github/workflows/build-deb.yml`](.github/workflows/build-deb.yml)
runs tests and qualification for pull requests and pushes to `main`, then calls
`./build.sh` to build amd64, arm64, and riscv64 packages. It verifies package
metadata, native runtime/version output, checksums, and a disposable local
repository before uploading only the `.deb` files and `SHA256SUMS.txt` as a
workflow artifact. The temporary repository and qualification signing keys are
removed; neither is uploaded.

Ordinary runs use a non-release `0.0.0~ci.<run-number>` version. A manual run
may supply an explicit Debian version, but that still creates only a
versioned CI artifact: the workflow does not create tags or authorize a
release. GitHub Actions has read-only repository permissions and no production
credentials, production signing key, or VServer access.

Production publication is a separate authorized operation and is not qualified
by this repository-contract work. A release runner must use the approved hosted
staging workflow, build from an exact authorized source revision, independently
verify the result, and keep signing authority outside the TPA build. CI success
and CI artifacts do not publish to or mutate a production repository and do
not authorize publication.

## 10,000-package benchmark snapshot

The authoritative post-Phase-B measurements were collected on the exact
committed reader at `078b62977e3cdec78fc84191172780f73468750f`. On Debian 13,
Linux 6.12.107, a Ryzen 7 5800X (8 cores/16 logical CPUs), the 10,000-package
control-reader oracle matched `dpkg-deb -f` with zero mismatches: 4.128 s
in-process versus 34.589 s for the oracle loop (8.38x).

A separate signed Pack sweep used benchmark-only stage instrumentation and a
complete generation manifest; each worker count had three trials. Median wall
times at 1/2/4/8/16 workers were 5.330/2.940/1.830/1.340/1.260 s. All 15 runs
read 10,000 packages directly and had zero fallbacks. Eight workers is the
practical throughput knee: 16 workers improved median wall time by 6.0% over 8,
with 2.0% more CPU and 10.1% more peak RSS. This instrumented sweep is distinct
from the standard, uninstrumented repository-comparison run; do not compare the
two as identical workloads.

The fresh repository comparison measured standard TPA initial generation at
1.110 s, aptly at 339.170 s, and reprepro at 16.390 s. Update medians were
1.160/4.710/0.290 s respectively, but update semantics differ: aptly retained
10,100 indexed entries while TPA and reprepro each reported 10,000. The package-build
orchestration sweep measured 85.38/36.34/19.58/11.33/12.62/9.55 s at
1/2/4/8/16/32 workers; intermediate counts were single observations, so no
precise optimum is established.

These figures are workload- and environment-specific. Full methodology,
validation status, caveats, and raw evidence locations are in
[`bench/REPORT.md`](bench/REPORT.md) and [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md).
The corrected validator distinguishes the unsigned manifest-scale fixture
from signed repository checks: the unsigned inventory has no signing artifact,
while signed cases require and verify `InRelease`. The complete recheck passed
against an isolated copy of the retained comparison results.

## Optional future work

The following are optional repository-format improvements, not baseline
requirements:

- APT by-hash indexes
- detached `Release.gpg` output
