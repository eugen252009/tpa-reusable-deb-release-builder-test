# TPA repository format v1

This document defines the repository tree emitted by TPA `pack`, including
`pack --empty`. It is a candidate interchange contract, not an APT trust format.
The repository's APT trust chain remains `InRelease` → `Release` → `Packages`
indexes → `.deb` bytes.

## Version discovery

Run `tpa capabilities` and parse its JSON document. Its top-level `format` is
`tpa-capabilities` and `version` is `1`. The
`repository_format.name` / `version` pair declares `tpa-apt-repository` v1;
`browser_index` / `browser_index_version` declares the paired browser sidecars.
Consumers must reject an unknown capabilities schema or repository format
version, and must independently approve the exact TPA binary/version they run.
The runtime version alone is not source provenance.

A repository tree identifies this format through its mandatory root
`repository.json` sidecar (`format: "tpa-repository-index"`, `version: 1`). In
v1, this browser-index marker maps to the enclosing `tpa-apt-repository` v1
contract; the capabilities document advertises both names and versions. The
sidecar pair is a format marker and convenience view, **not** a signature or
APT trust anchor. Generic APT repositories need not have these files.

## Tree and placement

For one distribution, one component, and one or more binary architectures:

```text
<root>/
├── index.html
├── repository.json
├── dists/<codename>/
│   ├── Release
│   ├── InRelease                         # optional; present when signed
│   └── <component>/
│       └── binary-<architecture>/
│           ├── Packages
│           └── Packages.gz
└── pool/<component>/
    └── <first-byte-of-package>/<package>/<original-input-basename>.deb
```

The canonical empty workflow is `tpa pack --empty`. It creates
`pool/<component>` and empty `Packages` and `Packages.gz` files for every
architecture. `pack --empty` defaults suite and codename to `stable`, component
to `main`, and architectures to `all`; these values may be overridden. Empty
initialization refuses every existing destination. Safe local initialization
uses an exclusive publication primitive
on Linux, Darwin, and Windows; other platforms report it unsupported in
`tpa capabilities`. SSH/SFTP output is supported to a new remote destination.
Normal `pack` infers architectures from actual `.deb` control stanzas and rejects
an empty artifact set; it does not convert an empty input directory into an
empty repository. To add packages to an existing local empty tree, use
`pack --atomic-publish` with the same suite, codename, component, and signing
policy. SSH/SFTP output instead publishes a complete package set only to a new
remote destination.

Paths are relative slash paths. Codename, component, architecture, and package
path segments must be safe canonical tokens; symlinks and special files are not
part of a TPA candidate. Each indexed `Filename` is under `pool/` and points to
the original artifact basename. Fresh `pack` output contains only artifacts in
its input set. `unlist` intentionally retains the removed `.deb` in `pool`, so a
lifecycle-mutated tree can have pool artifacts not referenced by current APT
indexes or `repository.json`; a hosted consumer must explicitly apply its
retention policy to such files rather than silently treating them as indexed.

TPA currently emits one component per repository. Multi-component output is not
part of v1. Architectures and package entries are sorted deterministically.

## APT metadata and trust

`Release` declares `Suite`, `Codename`, `Components`, sorted `Architectures`,
`Date`, and SHA256/size records for every plain and gzip `Packages` index.
`Packages.gz` must decompress byte-for-byte to `Packages`. Each package stanza
preserves the source `.deb` control metadata, except `Filename`, `Size`, and
`SHA256`, which TPA derives from the published artifact bytes. The canonical
identity is `Package + Version + Architecture`; byte-identical duplicates are
indexed once and conflicting bytes for one identity fail.

For every indexed package, a consumer must safely resolve `Filename` inside the
candidate tree, require a regular file, compare the actual size and SHA256 with
`Packages`, and parse the `.deb` control stanza to confirm the exact identity.
The Release SHA256/size records must match every index. If `InRelease` is
present, verify its clear-signature and exact signed `Release` payload against
an explicitly trusted public key/fingerprint. Never infer trust from the
browser files. TPA uses GPG from its caller's environment when `-gpg` is
provided; it does not embed signing secrets in the tree.

## Browser sidecars

`index.html` and `repository.json` are an inseparable pair at the repository
root. TPA generates both from the APT `Packages` indexes named by `Release`.
They contain no scripts, credentials, or additional package authority. They are
not included in the `Release` checksum section and are not covered by
`InRelease`; serve them as untrusted display metadata.

`repository.json` is UTF-8 JSON with this v1 shape:

```json
{
  "format": "tpa-repository-index",
  "version": 1,
  "packages": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "Package": "example",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "Architecture": "all"
      },
      "artifact": {
        "filename": "pool/main/e/example/example_1.0_all.deb",
        "size": 1234,
        "sha256": "<64 lowercase hexadecimal characters>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`metadata` is the complete preserved package control stanza represented as a
string-to-string object, excluding `Filename`, `Size`, and `SHA256`. `artifact`
contains those derived values. Entries are sorted by Package, Version,
Architecture, then Filename. Empty repositories use `"packages": []`. JSON
object key order and indentation are stable in TPA output but consumers must
parse JSON rather than depend on whitespace. The static HTML page uses
repository-relative links and HTML escaping; it does not require JavaScript.

`VerifyTPARepositoryTree` checks the APT trust chain, package identities, and
paired sidecars byte-for-byte against current APT indexes. Its `Config.Repo`
values must describe the expected Release metadata, and `Config.GPG` selects the
expected signer when set. It also enforces the
v1 directory/file allowlist, canonical distribution/component/index layout,
safe pool placement, regular files, and bounded file/directory/package counts.
Pool-only `.deb` files retained by `unlist` must still parse and match their
package directory and declared architecture; they have no current APT index
hash and remain subject to the consumer's retention/inventory policy. Generic
`tpa verify` intentionally remains compatible with ordinary APT repositories
that have no TPA sidecars; it does not establish the strict v1 tree contract or
reject arbitrary extra files.

## Determinism and inventory

`Packages`, `Packages.gz` (gzip `-n`), and browser sidecars are deterministic
for the same package bytes and repository metadata. By default `Release.Date`
uses the current UTC time. Set a non-negative `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to make that
field reproducible. OpenPGP signatures may still vary. A generation manifest is
kept outside the repository root and hashes the complete file inventory; it is
transport metadata and does not replace APT signature or semantic validation.

A hosted candidate consumer must compare its bounded transport inventory with
the actual tree, reject path traversal, symlinks, special files, unexpected
files, duplicate paths, and resource-limit violations, then independently
validate this format and the APT trust chain. Do not treat a valid inventory as
proof that the repository is valid.
